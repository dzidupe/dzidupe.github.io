# Crypto Dashboard

A high-performance, modular cryptocurrency trading dashboard for real-time order books, interactive price charts, and advanced market metrics. Designed for extensibility, maintainability, and sub-100ms update latency, this dashboard supports BTC, ETH, LTC, and SOL, and is engineered for robust operation under high market volatility. The codebase emphasizes clean architecture, centralized utilities, and explicit resource management for production-grade reliability.

## Codebase Overview

Crypto Dashboard is architected for low-latency data handling, efficient visualization, and reliable operation under volatile market conditions. The modular architecture separates data acquisition, processing, and rendering, ensuring scalability and maintainability. All utilities, error handling, and retry logic are centralized for consistency and ease of extension. The codebase is organized into clear domains: core modules, indicators, profiles, and utilities, each with a well-defined API and lifecycle.

### Recent Stability, Efficiency, and Speed Improvements

- **Chart Scroll Lock Improvement (June 2024):** The interactive price chart now remains stable after the user scrolls away from the latest price. The chart will not automatically snap back to the right edge (latest price) when new data arrives, unless the user is already at the latest bar. This provides a smoother and more user-friendly charting experience.

#### Code Architecture Refactoring (May 2025)

- **Background Data Store Refactor (June 2024):**
  - All indicator data updates (CVD, PerpCVD, PerpImbalance) are now managed by global background data stores.
  - UI components subscribe/unsubscribe to these stores, ensuring data stays fresh even when indicators are not visible.
  - Eliminated redundant update intervals and memory leaks by decoupling data logic from UI lifecycle.
  - Improved stability: No more import/export or redeclaration errors, and indicator updates are robust across navigation.
  - Classic script compatibility: All data store APIs are attached to `window` for global access, supporting legacy and modern browsers.

- **Centralized Configuration System:**  
  Implemented a global configuration system (`config.js`) that centralizes all settings, constants, and parameters previously scattered throughout the codebase. This significantly reduces duplication and makes the application more maintainable and configurable.

- **Modular API Client:**  
  Created a unified API client (`api-client.js`) that handles all market data fetching with automatic fallbacks between exchanges. This replaces duplicated API fetching code across multiple files with a single, robust implementation.

- **Component Factory System:**  
  Developed a component factory (`component-factory.js`) that programmatically generates UI elements, reducing HTML duplication and making the interface more consistent and easier to maintain.

- **Drawing Primitives Factory:**  
  Implemented a primitive factory (`primitive-factory.js`) for chart drawing elements, properly encapsulating rendering logic and making it easier to extend with new visualization types.

  - 502/504 (Gateway/Timeout): Retry with 1sâ30s delay, fallback to alternate endpoints if available.
- **WebSocket Errors**:  
  - Connection loss: Automatic reconnect with exponential backoff.
  - Sequence errors: Resubscribe with full snapshot recovery.
  - Circuit breaker logic halts reconnects after repeated failures, resuming after cooldown.
- **User Notification**:  
  - All critical errors and missing dependencies are surfaced in the UI via the integrated notification system.

### Troubleshooting

#### Indicator Data Not Updating or "is not a function" Errors

- Ensure that all data store scripts (e.g., `cvdDataStore.js`, `perpCvdDataStore.js`, `perpImbalanceDataStore.js`) are loaded **before** any indicator scripts in your HTML.
- Do not use `async` or `defer` on these scripts unless you are certain of the order.
- All data store APIs (e.g., `subscribeCVD`, `subscribePerpCVD`, `subscribePerpImbalance`) are attached to `window` and must be accessed as such.
- If you see redeclaration or import/export errors, check for duplicate variable names or stray import statements and remove them.
- After making changes, always perform a hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`) to clear browser cache.


- **Circuit Breaker Events**: Check logs from `circuitBreakerManager.js` for automatic shutdowns or restarts.
- **Error Analytics Dashboard**: Use data from `errorAnalytics.js` to identify recurring issues.

- **WebSocket Issues**:  
  - Check your network connection and firewall settings.
  - Enable `?debug=true` for verbose logs and diagnostics.
  - Verify WebSocket endpoints are reachable and use `wss://` URLs.
  - If persistent disconnects occur, check for API rate limits or maintenance notices from exchanges.

- **Performance Lag**:  
  - Ensure WebGL is enabled (e.g., set `webgl.disabled` to `false` in Firefox `about:config`).
  - Reduce the number of active indicators and overlays.
  - Close unused browser tabs and background applications.
  - Monitor FPS and event loop lag via the debug UI.

- **Data Gaps**:  
  - Clear IndexedDB storage:
    ```js
    indexedDB.deleteDatabase('chartData')
    ```
  - Check API rate limits (e.g., Bitstamp: 8000 requests per 10 minutes).
  - Use the debug mode to inspect REST and WebSocket responses.

- **Diagnostics**:  
  - Use browser DevTools (Network tab) to inspect WebSocket frames and REST calls.
  - Monitor FPS and memory usage in debug mode (`?debug=true`).
  - Review the integrated error notification UI for actionable feedback.

- **Console Errors**:  
  - All critical errors and missing dependencies are surfaced in the UI.
  - Use the error notification system for troubleshooting tips and quick links to documentation.

- **Resource Cleanup**:  
  - Ensure all charts, canvases, and WebGL resources are properly disposed of when switching views or trading pairs.
  - If charts fail to render after switching, clear the relevant data cache and forcibly clean up the DOM before re-initializing.

- **BTC Chart Not Rendering After Switch**:  
  - This may be due to stale cached data or incomplete DOM cleanup.
  - Fix: Clear the BTC chart data cache and forcibly clean up the chart DOM before re-initializing. This ensures the chart is always fully re-rendered when switching back to BTC.

- **Still Stuck?**  
  - Open an issue on GitHub with logs, browser version, and steps to reproduce.
  - Consult the FAQ and documentation for common issues and solutions.

### Testing

- Background data stores and indicator subscriptions can be tested by simulating data updates and verifying that UI components receive updates even when remounted or navigated away from and back.
- Ensure that unsubscribe logic is called on component unmount to prevent memory leaks.

- If you add or plan to add test files, document their location and usage here. (No test files were found in the current directory structure.)

- **Unit Tests**:  
  - Validate all core utilities (EMA, stdev, normalization), indicator calculations, and WebSocket handlers.
  - Use Jest or Mocha for automated test coverage.
- **Integration Tests**:  
  - Verify end-to-end data flow, component synchronization, and UI updates.
  - Simulate real-time data streams and user interactions.
- **Performance Tests**:  
  - Benchmark order book and chart rendering (target: 1000 updates < 100ms).
  - Measure FPS, event loop lag, and memory usage under load.
- **Memory Tests**:  
  - Detect leaks and ensure proper resource disposal on teardown and view switches.
  - Use browser profiling tools and automated scripts.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:  
  - GitHub Actions with Node.js 18.x, running all test suites, linting, and performance checks on every push and pull request.
  - Automated deployment to staging or production environments (optional).
- **Manual QA**:  
  - Cross-browser and cross-device testing for UI consistency and performance.
  - Regression testing after major updates or dependency changes.

### Security

- **WebSocket Security**:  
  - All connections use secure `wss://` endpoints.
  - Message validation and heartbeat monitoring prevent stale or malicious data.
  - Circuit breaker logic protects against repeated failures and denial-of-service attempts.

- **API Security**:  
  - All REST and WebSocket APIs use HTTPS.
  - Rate limiting and exponential backoff prevent abuse and accidental bans.
  - All responses are validated and sanitized before processing.

- **Client-Side Security**:  
  - Input sanitization and strict XSS prevention throughout the UI.
  - Secure storage of sensitive data (never store API keys or secrets in local storage).
  - Encrypted session data where applicable.

- **Monitoring & Auditing**:  
  - Real-time failure tracking and audit logging for all critical operations.
  - Integrated error notification UI for immediate user feedback.

- **Dependency Management**:  
  - Central loader/checker ensures all required libraries are present, up-to-date, and integrity-checked.
  - Regular audits for vulnerable or outdated dependencies.

- **Best Practices**:  
  - No sensitive credentials are ever hardcoded or exposed in the client.
  - Follow OWASP recommendations for web application security.
